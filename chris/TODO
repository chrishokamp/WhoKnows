Python tfidf module - RD done

Build and test server
	- takes a query and returns formatted JSON as result
		- needs a get queryVector def
	- server loads persisted idf and tfidfIndexes
	- for the first iteration, just compares every person to the query vector
	- may need to do some keyword/query expansion to give us more to go on 
	- output of server must be JSON
	- could be a list of names/ids, then we go to mySQL to get the columns for that entity
